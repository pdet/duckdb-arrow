# group: [nanoarrow]

# NOTE: for now there's not much we can test here, since we cannot really pass pointers from the
#       serialized blobs to the scan_arrow_ipc function in SQL. Therefore tests of these features
#       currently live in the NodeJS client tests.

# Test operator caching behaviour is sane
